            <h2>Cats are great pets. But why? What benefits do they have over other pets?</h2>
            </br>
            <h4>Here are some things:</h4>
            <li>Cats are independent, which means they can do things for themselves.</li>
            <li>They are more calm than other animals, such as dogs. You don't always have to be playing with them!</li>
            <li>They like to sleep and are soft, which makes them great to rest with!</li>
