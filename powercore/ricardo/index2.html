            <h3>So you need an electronic fixed? We don't fix nothin' for no one for nothin'.</h3>
            </br>
            
            <h3>Once again, here's what we do. Prices are below:</h3>
            <li>We can help you if you lose your archive files.</li>
            <li>If your electronic has a virus, we can try to help you get it off of your device!</li>
            <li>Is your computer really slow? Maybe it has a problem that we can fix!</li>
            <li>We accept any credit card!(but preferably CA$H!)</li>
            </br>
            <p>We charge $9.99 USD for a simple fix, such as getting your files back. We charge $24.99 USD for taking care of a virus or other things that take longer. For fixing a slow laptop, we charge $4.99 USD because it is probably just a small fix. We accept VISA, MASTERCARD, CAPITALONE, and lots of other credit cards.</p>
