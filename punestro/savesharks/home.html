<h2>Why Should I save sharks?</h2>
<p>Sharks are very important creatures to the ecosystem and if they are all gone, many fish that are prey of sharks will grow to a very imbalanced number. Also, when there is an increase in the number of a population, it means more food is consumed. This would start a chain reaction of starvation, overpopulation, and ultimately, mass extinction.</p>

<h2>Arn't sharks dangerous man-eaters?</h2>
<p>The short answer to that question is "no". The long answer to that question is "definetely not". But what about all of( those movies that come out about sharks and that all they care about is eating people. Well, those are fake. Yes, sharks only care about food. But, like us, they want good food. To them, they would rather eat a fish than a human any day of the week. The only reason sharks attack humans is typically out of fear or because a surfboard looks a lot like a seal or a fish. In fact, a person is more likely to die by lightning than a shark attack. The chances of being attacked are about 1 to 12 million and the chaces of lightning are 1 and 180,000. If you want to look this up, go to <a target="_blank" href="https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/all-injuries/preventable-death-overview/odds-of-dying/">this site here.</a> To put this in prespective, you are more likely to, die falling out of bed, die by a vending machine, die from an icycle falling on you, get killed by champagne corks, be killed by a dog, ant, bee, horse, hippo, or a cow.<a href="https://kafe.com/news/25-shocking-things-more-likely-to-kill-you-than-a-shark">(Source site)</a> Now of course you don't see any movies coming out called 'revenge of champagne corks' or 'the vender of death'.</p>

  <h2>Is it that urgent for me to help save sharks?</h2>
  <p>Here is what an article from Pewtrusts.org says about the urgency. The article gave five reasons on why it is so important to save sharks. Here they are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An estimated 100 million sharks are killed in commercial fisheries every year.</li>
    <li>Sharks are biologically vulnerable.(Meaning that they do not reproduce and grow very quickly)</li>
    <li>More than 50 percent of shark and ray species that have been fully assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature are Threatened or Near Threatened with extinction(Uh oh is right)</li>
    <li>Over 50 percent of the annual global shark fin trade passes through Hong Kong.Over 50 percent of the annual global shark fin trade passes through Hong Kong.</li>
    <li>Sharks are often worth more alive than dead.(Meaning that it is better for you to make money on a live shark(like in aquariums) than on some sellable food.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What can I do?</h2>
  <p>Well, there are a few options. You can simply protect sharks by telling people the truth. Tell people the facts about who really are the killers. Make a website like what I did in order to spread the facts and horrible things that are happening. Stop using nets that could trap and kill sharks. Sharks need constant ater flowing through them to breath and if they get trapped they would suffocate... You can also help by donating to shark saving organizations. Donating to these organizations will help them save more sharks. Or you can simply keep a strictly-non-shark diet. The biggest reason that sharks are killed is because they are such a hot comodity in many lands. So don't make the motivation stronger and save sharks. Save them before it's too late.</p>
